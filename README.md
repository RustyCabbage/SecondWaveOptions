# SecondWaveOptions
Adds some simple, totally optional settings of varying silliness to spice up your game.

# Current Features
- 🧾 Book of Grudges (negative rep with factions--and optionally players--lingers)
- 🔫 Autofit Tweaks (super minor, just reduces autofit randomness atm)
- 🏴‍☠️ Pirate Scholars (now they can learn things automatically! 🤓 )
- 📗 Blessed By Ludd (gives LP ships a chance to suppress Ill-Advised Mods)
- 👑 Make Sindria Great Again (gives LG and Diktat ships a chance to suppress Special Modifications)
- 📈 Doctrine Scaling (your favorite feature from last time, maybe, now better, maybe! if you're new here it means factions now scale, pog?)
- 📉 Commodity Scaling (silly, experimental way of reducing the amount of commodities you can purchase in markets. stop engaging in arbitrage and go kill things)
- 📵 No Free Storage (disables the free storage in the three abandoned stations in the Core Worlds. Ones outside the Core aren't affected, should they exist 👀)
- 🔐 Secure Markets (that other feature that at least one person liked, more or less the same! markets have defenses and stations and in some cases, annoying patrols!)

if you give me cool, easily implemented ideas, they probably won't get added to the mod! (but i promise i'll think about it)

- **Everything is togglable and editable in LunaLib**, which is pog.
   - you can turn everything off and have a mod that does nothing!!
- **Should be safe to add and remove at any point**, which is very pog.
   - but i didn't mark it utility so don't blame me for anything ty
- **If you download this mod, I will like you at least a little bit more than if you didn't**, and really, what could be more pog than that?
   - *terms and conditions apply*
