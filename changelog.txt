Current Features
- 🔫 Autofit Tweaks (super minor, just reduces autofit randomness atm)
- 🏴‍☠️ Pirate Scholars (now they can learn things automatically! 🤓 )
- 📗 Blessed By Ludd (gives LP ships a chance to suppress Ill-Advised Mods)
- 👑 Make Sindria Great Again (gives LG and Diktat ships a chance to suppress Special Modifications)
- 📈 Doctrine Scaling (your favorite feature from last time, maybe, now better, maybe! if you're new here it means factions now scale, pog?)
- 📉 Commodity Scaling (silly, experimental way of reducing the amount of commodities you can purchase in markets. stop engaging in arbitrage and go kill things)
- 📵 No Free Storage (disables the free storage in the three abandoned stations in the Core Worlds. Ones outside the Core aren't affected, should they exist 👀)
- 🔐 Secure Markets (that other feature that at least one person liked, more or less the same! markets have defenses and stations and in some cases, annoying patrols!)
